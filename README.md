### Problem
-------------
GHP was such a fun experience, but there was one problem that occured every day - buddying up with atleast one other person after 7PM on campus to ensure safety. 
There would be times when students wouldn't be able to find even a single buddy, as they might be in a secluded place or just in the wrong place at the wrong
time. So, we thought of making this application for all GHPers during the Summer of 2019. 

### Solution
--------------
We decided to use a Firebase backend using Cloud Firestore for storing data and Firebase functions to run our notification SMS service (Twilio) in the background.
